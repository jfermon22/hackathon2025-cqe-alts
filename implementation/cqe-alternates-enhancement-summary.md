## Integration Points (Future)

The POC includes placeholders for:
1. **Bedrock Agent**: Generate search queries from form inputs
2. **Amazon Product Search API**: Real product search with generated queries
3. **Supplier Summarization**: PII-free context for suppliers

## Testing

To test the updated functionality:
1. Load the CQE page with the userscript
2. Click "Add Alternates" on any product
3. Try adding manual ASINs (test with: B08N5WRWNW, B07XYZ1234)
4. Fill out the form fields
5. Click "Suggest Alternates" to see mock products
6. Select some alternates by clicking tiles
7. Submit to see the payload structure

## Files Modified

- `cqe-alternates-enhancement.user.js`: Main userscript with POC functionality
- `modalPOC.html`: Original POC (reference implementation)

The userscript now provides the same functionality as the POC while maintaining integration with the existing CQE page structure and styling.
