# Implementation Plan - CQE Alternate Selection Enhancement

## Overview

This implementation plan breaks down the CQE Alternate Selection Enhancement into manageable tasks that can be executed by Q or another agent. The plan follows a modular approach, building from basic UI components to full LLM integration.

**UPDATED**: Now includes detailed HTML interface analysis from actual CQE page structure. See `html-interface-analysis.md` for complete technical details.

## Phase 1: Foundation & UI Setup

### Task 1.1: Greasemonkey Script Foundation ✅ UPDATED
**Objective**: Create the basic Greasemonkey script structure and inject the "Add Alternates" button

**Key Changes Based on HTML Analysis**:
- **Target Location**: Add button to existing "Manage item" dropdown menu instead of standalone button
- **Specific Selectors**: Use identified CSS selectors from actual CQE interface
- **Integration Point**: Modify `.b-dropdown-menu` elements in product table rows

**Deliverables**:
- `cqe-alternates-enhancement.user.js` - Main Greasemonkey script
- Button injection into existing dropdown menus
- Product data extraction from table rows
- Basic event handling setup

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Script loads on CQE buyer request pages (detected via breadcrumb and header)
- "Add Alternates" option appears in each product's "Manage item" dropdown
- Button click extracts product context (ASIN, name, quantity, price)
- No interference with existing CQE functionality

**Updated Implementation Details**:
```javascript
// ==UserScript==
// @name         CQE Alternate Selection Enhancement

## Implementation Order

### Recommended Execution Sequence:
1. **Phase 1** (Foundation) - Essential for all subsequent work
2. **Phase 2** (Conversation Logic) - Core functionality
3. **Phase 3** (ASIN Management) - User input handling
4. **Phase 4** (LLM Integration) - Replace mocks with real functionality
5. **Phase 5** (Amazon API) - Product data integration
6. **Phase 6** (CQE Integration) - Complete the workflow
7. **Phase 7** (Testing & Polish) - Finalize for production

### Parallel Development Opportunities:
- Tasks 1.2 and 1.3 can be developed in parallel
- Tasks 3.1 and 3.2 can be developed independently
- Phase 4 tasks can begin once Phase 2 is complete
- Testing can begin incrementally after each phase

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks:
1. **Strands SDK Integration**: Create fallback mock service if integration fails
2. **Amazon API Access**: Prepare mock data service as backup
3. **CQE API Changes**: Implement robust error handling and validation
4. **Cross-Origin Issues**: Plan for proxy or CORS solutions

### User Experience Risks:
1. **LLM Response Time**: Implement loading states and timeout handling
2. **Complex Requirements**: Provide guided input options as fallback
3. **Mobile Compatibility**: Ensure responsive design works on all devices
